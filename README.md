# Next.js Application

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To start the development server, run one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

After the server starts, open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal output (commonly `http://localhost:3000`, unless another port is used).

You can begin editing the application by modifying the `app/page.js` file. Changes will automatically be reflected in the browser.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a modern font developed by Vercel.
